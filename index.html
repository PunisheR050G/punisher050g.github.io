    <h1>Freshwater Use</h1>
    <h2>Global freshwater use</h2>
    <p>
        A growing global population and economic shift towards more resource-intensive consumption patterns means that global freshwater use has increased approximately six-fold since 1900. Freshwater use includes freshwater withdrawals for agriculture, industry, and municipal uses. This is shown in the chart. Rates of global freshwater use increased sharply from the 1950s onwards but since 2000 appear to be plateauing, or at least slowing.
